## Project Brief: Data Pipeline using Airflow
# Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a data pipeline using Apache Airflow to automate the process of obtaining, transforming, and visualizing data. The pipeline will consist of four main parts: data acquisition (web scraping), data transformation (using pandas), data storage (CSV), and data visualization (Streamlit.io). The pipeline will be scheduled to run daily.

Part 1: Obtaining the Data (Web Scraping)
The data engineers will be responsible for implementing web scraping to collect the required data from one or multiple websites. They should identify the relevant data sources, design the web scraping logic, and extract the necessary data using libraries such as BeautifulSoup or Scrapy. The extracted data should be stored in a structured format (e.g., pandas DataFrame) for further processing.

Part 2: Transforming the Data (Pandas)
Once the data is obtained, the data engineers will use pandas, a powerful data manipulation library in Python, to transform and clean the collected data. This step involves performing operations such as filtering, aggregating, merging, and cleaning the data to make it suitable for analysis and visualization. The transformed data should be stored in pandas DataFrames for further processing.

Part 3: Saving Data to CSV and Uploading to AWS S3
After the data has been transformed, the data engineers will save the pandas DataFrames into CSV files. These CSV files will serve as the intermediate storage for the data. Additionally, the data engineers will use the AWS SDK (Boto3) to upload the CSV files to an S3 bucket on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Proper authentication and access controls should be implemented to ensure data security.

Part 4: Reading CSV Data from S3 for Visualization using Streamlit.io
In the final part of the pipeline, the data engineers will develop a Streamlit.io application to visualize the data stored in the CSV files. Streamlit.io is a popular Python library for building interactive web applications for data exploration and visualization. The engineers will read the CSV data from the S3 bucket using the AWS SDK and use Streamlit.io to create visualizations, interactive dashboards, or any other desired data presentation format. The Streamlit.io application should be deployed and accessible for end-users to explore the data.

# Airflow Data Pipeline
To automate and orchestrate the entire process, the data engineers will use Apache Airflow, an open-source platform for creating, scheduling, and monitoring workflows. The provided code demonstrates a basic Airflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) with tasks representing the different parts of the data pipeline.

The DAG starts with the task "process_csv" that calls the process_csv function, responsible for saving the data to a local CSV file and uploading it to the specified S3 bucket. Next, the task "visualize_data" calls the visualize_data function, responsible for reading the CSV data from the S3 bucket and creating visualizations using Streamlit.io.

The DAG is scheduled to run daily (schedule_interval="@daily") and has the catchup=False parameter to avoid backfilling missed runs.

Data engineers should modify and expand the DAG by implementing the web scraping logic, data transformation, and any additional tasks required to complete the project. Each task should be implemented as a separate operator or Python function and connected using appropriate dependencies to form the complete data pipeline.

Please note that the provided code includes commented-out sections that can be used as a reference for implementing the missing functionality related to training models and choosing the best model based on accuracy. Feel free to uncomment and adapt these sections if they are relevant to your project.

For any questions or assistance during the development process, please refer to the Airflow documentation, pandas documentation, AWS SDK (Boto3) documentation, and Streamlit.io documentation, or consult with the project team.
